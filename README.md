# Airplane-Stability-Simulation-with-MATLAB
This code simulates the longitudinal stability of an aircraft by numerically integrating the equations of motion for velocity and pitch angle. The control input applied is elevator deflection, which is adjusted based on the difference between the current pitch angle and a desired reference angle (theta0).

Note: This code provides a basic example and may need further refinement for specific aircraft models or control laws. Additionally, it assumes a linearized model and neglects some nonlinear effects for simplicity.
